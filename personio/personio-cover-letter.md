Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm reaching out about the Engineering Manager position. With my hands-on approach and track record of building high-performing teams, I believe I'd be a great fit for this role.

In my current role at Payjoy, I've scaled our engineering team from 3 to over 30 developers across multiple squads. I have been building and training developer teams over the last 25 years or more, this is the most recent experience that can support my solid foundation in delivery and execution for teams. I'm all about taking ownership and making things happen, working closely with our tech leads to ensure we're hitting our marks with quality and an inspired team.

When it comes to engineering excellence, I'm not one to settle. I've set up training programs and mentoring systems that have significantly upped our game. For instance, I spearheaded the implementation of a company-wide project management workflow using JIRA (company's choice, but we have to use the tools we have), which got all our devs (over 90 of them) on the same page. This kind of initiative is right up my alley - I love setting a high bar and making sure everyone knows what we're aiming for.

Lastly, I'm a big believer in sharing knowledge and best practices. In my time at Payjoy and in my previous roles, I've always looked for ways to contribute to company-wide standards and practices. Whether it's through formal channels or just chatting with other managers, I'm always looking to learn and share.

I'm stoked about the possibility of bringing my brand of hands-on leadership to your team. I reckon my experience in scaling teams, fostering excellence, and driving both technical and people growth could be a real asset.

I am sure I can make a positive impact in Personios' teams and individuals, and help improving processes and metrics, maintaining quality and shortening the time to production.

Looking forward to chatting more about how I can help drive your team's success.

Cheers,
Francisco Castaneda
