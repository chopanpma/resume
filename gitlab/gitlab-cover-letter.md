Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Engineering Manager position for the Engineering Productivity team at GitLab. With over a decade of experience in engineering leadership and a passion for optimizing developer workflows, I believe I am uniquely qualified to lead your team in its mission to increase productivity and efficiency across GitLab's engineering organization.

In my current role as Engineering Manager at Payjoy Inc, I have successfully scaled our engineering team from 3 to over 30 developers across multiple squads. This experience aligns perfectly with GitLab's need for an experienced manager who can lead a team focused on improving development efficiency and streamlining workflows. Some of my key achievements that demonstrate my fit for this role include:

1. Implementing company-wide project management workflows using JIRA, unifying processes for over 90 developers. This initiative significantly improved cross-team collaboration and visibility, directly addressing GitLab's goal of building partnerships across organizational boundaries.

2. Coordinating the creation of an on-call rotation working with more than 10 teams, which improved our incident response times and reduced engineer burnout. This experience will be invaluable in developing strategies to enhance developer velocity and overall team productivity at GitLab.

3. As CTO at Adelantos Capital Corp, I built a team and infrastructure from scratch, implementing microservices and infrastructure as code. This resulted in a platform capable of handling hundreds of thousands of monthly transactions, showcasing my ability to manage and maintain developer tooling and infrastructure for optimal performance. In this position we were evaluating our git hosting platform and decided to go by gitlab, now our new company "Payjoy" is using gitlab but at the time we took the decision we felt more identified with gitlab's offering and that part of the team is still using Gitlab. 

4. Throughout my career, I have consistently focused on shortening the time between idea conception and feature deployment. This aligns perfectly with GitLab's mission to shorten feedback loops and improve workflow efficiency.

My experience with technologies such as Kubernetes, Kafka, and various CI/CD tools positions me well to identify, evaluate, and implement new technologies that support engineering efficiency. Furthermore, my background in creating training teams and establishing incident handling processes demonstrates my commitment to fostering a culture of continuous improvement.

I am particularly excited about the opportunity to measure and improve quality of life, efficiency, and toil reduction with both quantitative and qualitative measures. My data-driven approach to management and strong analytical skills will enable me to track key metrics related to engineering productivity and report on progress and impact effectively.

As someone who has successfully led remote teams and worked in distributed environments, I am well-equipped to thrive in GitLab's remote-first culture. My strong communication and interpersonal skills have been honed through years of collaborating with diverse stakeholders across different time zones and cultures.

I am enthusiastic about the possibility of bringing my expertise in engineering leadership and productivity optimization to GitLab. I believe that my experience, skills, and passion for improving developer experiences make me an ideal candidate to lead the Engineering Productivity team in its crucial mission.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to GitLab's continued success.

Sincerely,

Francisco Castaneda
